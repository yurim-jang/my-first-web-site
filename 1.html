<p><u>"Hypertext"</u> refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser.HTML markup includes special "elements" such as</p>
<p><img src="TAG.jpg" width="100%"></p>
<p>An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "<"and">". The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <"title"> tag can be written as <"Title">, <"TITLE">, or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.</p>
